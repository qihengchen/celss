Averaging task - Online dataset



General information about the task
6 blocks (type and order of stimuli)
Each block has 30 (or 50) trials (rows)

NOTE: start with the length 30 trials per condition, but later I will ask you also to make the code flexible in case we have files of different lengths (right now, 30 and 50 trials per block)





Structure of the CSV file (from online task)
[each row indicates a trial of the experiment]

1) block_type
Text (two parts: order of appearence and type of visualization)
Simultaneous/Alternate/Sequential: order of appearance on the screen
Numbers/Bars: visualization of the stimuli

2) treatment
Text (up/down)
It indicates the treatment (upward or downward triangular distribution)

3) start_position
number or text (e.g. a_on_left)
0 = simultaneous
a_on_left = values listed as A appears first and on the left

4-9) setup_aX
Numeric - six numbers shown as A

10-15) setup_bX
Numeric - six numbers shown as B

16) total_left
17) total_right
Numeric - Sum of the values on the left/right (notice that A/B does not mean left/right)

18) waiting_elapsed
Numeric - Response time, in milliseconds

19) side_chosen
Text (left/right)
Which side is chosen by the participant

20) choice_correct
Boolean (TRUE/FALSE)
True if the chosen side has a value larger (or equal) than the other one

Note: this variable appears twice (two separate columns), just ignore the second time it appears

IGNORE ALL THE REMAINING COLUMNS FROM 21 ONWARDS






STEP 1: TRANSFORM ALL THE VARIABLES BELOW INTO NUMBERS (change booleans and text into numbers)

1) block_type: it becomes
sim-num = 1
alt-num = 2
seq-num = 3
sim-bar = 4
alt-bar = 5
seq-bar = 6

2) treatment
up = 1
down = 2

3) start_position
0 stays 0
a_on_left = 1
a_on_right = 2
b_on_left = 3
b_on_right = 4

19) side_chosen
left = 0
right = 1

20) choice_correct
FALSE = 0
TRUE = 1




STEP 2: ADAPT THE FILE IN ORDER TO GET THE FOLLOWING COLUMNS (only numerical values)

1) participant_ID
[NEW - progressive ID for the participant]
1 for the first file, 2 for the second file, etc

2) treatment
[from treatment variable above]
1 = up, 2 = down

3) block_progressive_ID
[NEW - order of appearence of the blocks]
1 for the first one within the file, 2 for the second, etc, until 6

4) block_type_ID
[from block_type above]
1 = sim-num, etc

5) block_order
[NEW]
1 = simultaneous
2 = alternate
3 = sequential

6) block_stimuli
[NEW]
1 = numbers
2 = bars

7) trial_ID
[NEW - order of appearance of the trials within each block]
progressive values 1,...,30

8) starting_position
[NEW - which side is shown first]
0 = simultaneous
1 = left first
2 = right first

9-14) value_left_X
15-20) value_right_X
[adapted from the columns a/b]
NOTE: a and b do not always correspond to left/right (it depends on the value in column 3)
The goal is to have LEFT in the columns 9-14

21) total_left
22) total_right
23) waiting_elapsed 	(in milliseconds)
24) side_chosen			(left=0, right=1)
25) choice_correct		(false=0, true=1)
[ALL OF THESE exactly as above]
